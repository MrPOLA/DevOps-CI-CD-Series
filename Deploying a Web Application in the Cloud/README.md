**AWS SERVICES** - 
1. [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) 🖥️
2. VSCode 💻

⚡️ **30 Second Summary**: Welcome to your DevOps x AWS project series! In this SEVEN-project series, you will create a CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy a simple web application using AWS' Code services. Here's what you'll build at the end of ALL seven projects ⬇️.

🧠 **What's CI/CD? Why do this project?** Engineers are often working in big teams and collaborating on complex software projects. Managing the many, MANY changes in a project can get messy without the right processes in place. A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) pipeline is a key tool to automate the steps from development (i.e., created by developers) to deployment (i.e., published to users), which helps software get built and released even faster. 

In the first project of this series, you'll learn the basics of building a web app using AWS and another tool called VSCode. This will lay the foundation for your DevOps work for the rest of this series. Get ready to:

💻 Launch an EC2 instance.  
🔌 Use VSCode to set up a remote SSH connection to your EC2 instance.  
☕️ Install Maven and Java and generate a basic web app.
